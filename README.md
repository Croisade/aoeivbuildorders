# AOEIVBuildOrders

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how we're going to store this data in the backend. Mongo? Haskell?
- [ ] How do we generate shareable pages with links?
- [ ] Docker containers are we using pm2?
- [ ] seperate state for each table's count
- [ ] write out tests for each new feature that we introduce. Make our life easier
- [ ] Carefully think through table elements to prevent bugs
